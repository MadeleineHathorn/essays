# Othello Act 3 Scene 3
Iago manipulates Othello to believe that Desdemona is cheating with Cassio. 


>**IAGO:** </br>
> Good name in man and woman, dear my lord, </br>
> Is the immediate jewel of their souls.</br>
> Who steals my purse steals trash. ’Tis something,</br>
> nothing;</br>
> ’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to</br>
> thousands.</br>
> But he that filches from me my good name</br>
> Robs me of that which not enriches him</br>
> And makes me poor indeed.</br>

**OTHELLO:**    {By heaven}, I’ll know thy thoughts. </br>


**IAGO:** </br>
You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,</br>
Nor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody.</br>

**OTHELLO:** </br>
Ha?</br>

**IAGO:**          O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!</br>
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock</br>
The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss</br>
Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;</br>
But O, what damnèd minutes tells he o’er</br>
Who dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet strongly loves!</br>

**OTHELLO:**       O misery! </br>

**IAGO:** </br>
Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;</br>
But riches fineless is as poor as winter</br>
To him that ever fears he shall be poor.</br>
Good God, the souls of all my tribe defend</br>
From jealousy!</br>

**OTHELLO:**  Why, why is this?</br>
Think’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy,</br>
To follow still the changes of the moon</br>
With fresh suspicions? No. To be once in doubt</br>
Is once to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat</br>
When I shall turn the business of my soul</br>
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,</br>
Matching thy inference. ’Tis not to make me jealous</br>
To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,</br>
Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well.</br>
Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.</br>
Nor from **mine own weak merits** will I draw</br>
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,</br>
For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,</br>
I’ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;</br>
And on the proof, there is no more but this:</br>
Away at once with love or jealousy.
