# <span style="font-family:Zapfino; alignment:center;"> Othello Act 3 Scene 3  </span>

<span style="font-family:times new roman;"> _Iago manipulates Othello to believe that Desdemona is cheating with Cassio._


>**IAGO:** </br>
> Good name in man and woman, dear my lord, </br>
> Is the immediate jewel of their souls.</br>
> Who steals my purse steals trash. ’Tis something,</br>
> nothing;</br>
> ’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to</br>
> thousands.</br>
> But he that filches from me my good name</br>
> Robs me of that which not enriches him</br>
> And makes me poor indeed.</br>



 <p style="border:1px dashed crimson; padding:5px"><span style="font-family:times new roman">Iago reveals how he believes Othello has hurt him, and explains his choice of revenge. </span></p>



>**OTHELLO:**    {By heaven}, I’ll know thy thoughts. </br>


>**IAGO:** </br>
You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,</br>
Nor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody.</br>

>**OTHELLO:** </br>
Ha?</br>

>**IAGO:**       <span style="background:LawnGreen;">  O, beware, my lord, of jealousy! [^1] </br>
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock</br>
The meat it feeds on. </span>  That ==cuckold=={Q1483612} lives in bliss</br>
Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;  </br>
>*But O, what damnèd minutes tells he o’er</br>
Who dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet strongly loves!*</br>

 <p style="border:1px dashed crimson; padding:5px"><span style="font-family:times new roman">The other hurtful part of jealousy is the one who knows about infidelity but doesn't say anything, simply waiting instead of confronting. </span></p>

>**OTHELLO:**       O misery! </br>

>**IAGO:** </br>
Poor and content is rich, and rich enough; [^2] </br>
But <span style="background:#b6e1fc;"> riches fineless is as poor as winter </br>
To him that ever fears he shall be poor. </span> </br>
Good God, the souls of all my tribe defend</br>
From jealousy!</br>
>.ve-media wc:Lunar_phases_al-Biruni.jpg right
>**OTHELLO:**  Why, why is this?</br>
Think’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy,</br>
To follow still the changes of the moon</br>
With fresh suspicions? No. To be once in doubt</br>
Is once to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat</br>
When I shall turn the business of my soul</br>
To such [exsufflicate and blown](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/extant-species) surmises,</br>
Matching thy inference. ’Tis not to make me jealous</br>
To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,</br>
Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well.</br>
Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.</br>
Nor **from mine own weak merits will I draw**</br>
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,</br>
For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,</br>
I’ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;</br>
And on the proof, there is no more but this:</br>
Away at once with love or jealousy.

 <p style="border:1px dashed crimson; padding:5px"><span style="font-family:times new roman"> Othello reveals his stubborness, showcasing how easily Iago can subvert it to block out the possibility of Desdemona's innocence. </span></p>
